# Personalization Settings
This lets you personalize users settings through Flask REST APIs.

## Development setup

Please follow the following steps in order to getting started with development.

```bash

# 1) Change your current directory to project root directory
cd techtest/

# 2) Start development server which should be accessible at `localhost:5001` after the containers are up and running
docker-compose up --build

# This doesn't come with any user information already added to the database, in order to test this â€“ I have build the test cases that are covering all the API endpoints so please run those tests to observe how the APIs are behaving.

# Run unit tests (pytests)
docker compose exec web /bin/bash scripts/run_tests.sh

# SSH into the flask webapp container
docker compose exec web /bin/bash
```

## Contributing

Install precommit hooks with flake8, isort, black so that the best practices can be enforced on each commit you make:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
Now, do some violation and try to commit ;)
